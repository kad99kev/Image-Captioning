# Image-Captioning using PyTorch
[![Visualize in WandB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wandb/assets/main/wandb-github-badge-28.svg)](https://wandb.ai/kad99kev/image-captioning?workspace=user-kad99kev)

* This repository was intended to study about how image captioning systems work.
* The reference for the code was the Tensorflow tutorial on image captioning - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning
* This has been converted into PyTorch code.
* Notebooks make use of functions from the `utils` directory.
* [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) was used for logging. You can visit the logs [here](https://wandb.ai/kad99kev/image-captioning?workspace=user-kad99kev)
